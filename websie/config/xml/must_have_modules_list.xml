You know that this selection is appropriate and that it will appeal to your customers. Or you could even use your best-sellers, by adding them to those that are less visible, to allow your customers to discover them. Your packs will need to be made up of 2 products minimum, the number is unlimited.Push the quantity per product, choose the combinations of your choice, there are multiple options allowing you to multiply the possibilities. Would you like to reserve the purchase of a product within a pack?That is also possible! You will therefore be able to offer a free product if it is purchased as part of a pack. The possibilities are infinite! Integrated assistant It isn't always obvious deciding which products should be offered within a pack. Here again Advanced Pack has the solution to the problem.  When creating your pack, our module will supply you with strategic information, like the number of products sold or their available stock.   There is also an integrated dynamic price simulator for your pack, to help you see more clearly when creating your business operation. Remain the maestro of combinations One of the products that you have added to your pack is available in several colors, but you don't want to offer them all in this set?Advanced Pack will allow you to do this. You will also have the possibility of predefining a combination by default, for each of the products of your pack, even if it's different to the one defined in your catalog. Your customers will then be able to personalise their selection amongst the characteristics that you will have chosen to integrate in the offer. Business Incentive Incentive is something that motivates your visitor to make a purchase The main aim is to convince more of your site visitors to finish their order and/or spend more money per transaction.Perhaps you have already tried, by offering free delivery over a certain amount of purchases, or to offer discounts on certain products or even to send discount vouchers?All of these methods work, but their range is limited, as these promotions are usually temporary due to their excessive cost!Stop looking, you have already found the solution ! To entice your customers, Advanced Pack will give you the choice of applying a discount when all the products in the shopping cart are ordered, thus encouraging the purchase of the whole pack. 3 possibilities are available: Offer a specific discount on each product in the packApply a general discount on the set of productsApply a fixed price, such as a psychological price, for example Advanced Pack will also be able to manage the discounts already applied to your products, allowing you to integrate them in the pack price, or on the contrary, to exclude them, in order to choose the predefined discount on the pack.This decision will be made even easier thanks to our clear and clean-looking interface, that will allow you to see the discounted products very easily. You won't need to worry about the coherence of your prices anymore Have you ever had to review all the prices in your catalog, to detect any possible incoherences and correct them? What would happen if you had to manually manage the repercussions of these changes in product pricing in your packs? This would represent a significant extra workload if if it's not anticipated within the choice of management solutions within your packs! Once again Advanced Pack has the solution. By default, in the case where no reduction has been applied, the pack price is the sum of the products making it up.Should you need to modify the price of a product after having created the pack, the pack price will automatically be updated, and without you having to intervene. In those cases where you will apply a discount to one or more products in an existing pack, and on condition you have authorized the promotional implications, the pack price will also be changed, showing your customers the discount that has been applied. Is one of the products of your pack subject to an green-tax? No problem, it will automatically be reflected in the pack price and will be clearly stated, guaranteeing absolute respect for the legislation. Regarding the management of your stock, everything has been automated! For each pack ordered, the product stocks it contains will be automatically deducted. This way you will avoid the double management of stock or the frustration generated by sales rendered impossible, due to the bad assignation of quantities.Also, in the case where a product in a pack is out of stock, it will automatically be displayed as unavailable for purchase thanks to an availability warning system that is both elegant and modern. For your customers, we have integrated a graphic and fun notification system, allowing the instant identification of stock shortages on combinations or products making up the pack. There's no chance of you receiving orders for products that are out of stock ! Highlight your packs and sell more Once you have defined your pack, you will be able to configure it in the same way as you would a classic product. Everything is possible, such as assigning it customized images, classing it in the category of your choice, optimizing your SEO, writing a customized description, attributing it an EAN code or a specific reference, configuring its volume to calculate delivery costs, etc... For those that are pressed for time, and in order to facilitate their marketing, Advanced Pack will automatically display all the photos of the products that make it up, as well as their descriptions, in the form of tabs.Your customers will be correctly informed, without leaving the page of your pack, and able to finalise their purchase in one click. And that's not all... For more visibility, your packs will automatically be highlighted on their data sheets for those being sold in lotsThis way, you will encourage your customers to order the pack, rather than the product they were initially interested in. Essentially, this is cross-selling: an accessible method of increasing your average shopping cart ! We don't forget designers From the beginning, we have integrated the fact that this module should be easily adapted by your web agency or designer/integrator.The module adapts itself perfectly to the default PrestaShop 1.6 and 1.7 themes, whilst allowing the most advanced graphic personalization. A set of JavaScript templates and CSS style sheets are delivered as models with the module, to facilitate the integration process. Either yourself or your integrator will therefore be able to use all of the functionalities of the Advanced Pack 5 engine, in order to present them in the graphic form that will best correspond with the general atmosphere of your online store.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[merchandizing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[5.2.11]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.1.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.6.6]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[299.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[339.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[279.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pprod/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/616235-pbig/advanced-pack-5-create-bundles-of-products.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[1048]]></id><name><![CDATA[facebookpsshoptab]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Advanced Shop for Fan Page]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Products on Facebook & Social Networks]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Create a multilingual and completely customized Facebook shop]]></description><author><![CDATA[Business Tech]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/products-on-facebook-social-networks/1048-advanced-shop-for-fan-page.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/1048.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Create a multilingual and completely customized Facebook shop]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[* * * WINNER OF THE 2011 PRESTASHOP AWARDS CEREMONY FOR THE BEST MODULE * * *&nbsp;Stand out from the competition and present your products on Facebook in a completely customized shop tab that will differ from the shop tab natively offered by Facebook and used by many merchants.(x)&nbsp;Effective way to increase your sales, the &quot;Facebook shop&quot; has become essential in the e-commerce area.

The &ldquo;Free Delivery Manager&rdquo; module is actually the perfect solution for offering your respected customers free shipping through objective rules. It is the promise of a rise in the amount of orders with total control of delivery costs.  The module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.  The &ldquo;Free Delivery Manager&rdquo; module offers control of delivery costs by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to order more.  Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really control the impact of delivery costs.

This allows you to then serve ads to web users who have already interacted with your site, when they visit other Google partner websites or applications.But that's not all! Our module not only allows you to do classic remarketing, it also sets up dynamic remaketing tags. By enabling the feature and creating the link to your products on Merchant Center, you allow Google Ads tag to be much more accurate in its information collection: products, prices, cart amount, detail of products ordered, etc. as much essential data as you can then use to display ads to a former visitor containing the products that are most likely to interest him/her: recently viewed products, added to the cart but not ordered, of the same category, etc... A very effective way to get him/her back to place an order on your site and significantly improve your conversion rate! Our "Google Dynamic Remarketing" module does not require any technical skill. Simply enter the conversion ID provided in your Google Ads account, enable the dynamic retargeting feature and the module takes care of everything! In an instant, the code snippets are installed on your site and you start collecting data about your visitors in the Google Ads interface. ]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[advertising_marketing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.6.4]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[79.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[89.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[74.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/963140-pprod/google-dynamic-remarketing.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/963140-pbig/google-dynamic-remarketing.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[9783]]></id><name><![CDATA[gtrustedstores]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Google Customer Reviews]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Referral & Loyalty Programs]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Google Customer Reviews is a free program that lets you collect feedback from users who&rsquo;ve made a purchase on your site and display it (or not) for your future customers]]></description><author><![CDATA[Business Tech]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/referral-loyalty-programs/9783-google-customer-reviews.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/9783.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Google Customer Reviews is a free program that lets you collect feedback from users who&rsquo;ve made a purchase on your site and display it (or not) for your future customers.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[Reassure your customers and increase your conversion rate and sales on your PrestaShop website by joining the new customer feedback service by Google.&nbsp;Enjoy the following advantages by joining the &quot;Google Customer Reviews&quot; program :&nbsp;Freely collect necessary reviews about your shopAcquire the possibility to display reviews about merchant on your Google AdWords advertisementsShow a badge on your website with the Google Customer Reviews logo and the rating resulted from reviews.&nbsp;By using this module in conjunction with our &quot;Google Merchant Center (Google Shopping)&quot; module (available separately on https://addons.prestashop.com/en/price-comparison/1768-google-merchant-center-google-shopping.html), you will get the best possible results on the PrestaShop e-commerce platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;This module is developed and published by Business Tech, certified PrestaShop developer and winner of the 2011, 2014 and 2017 PrestaShop Awards for &quot;Best module&quot;, with over 7 years of experience working with Google and Facebook.

For that reason, PrestaShop Search Friendly Pretty URL module cleans the URLs that are user friendly as well as search engine friendly, it replaces randomly generated IDs from website addresses. Rather than using irrelevant characters in address like www.domain.com/1-product-A, the add-on cleans the URL and adds the name of product &amp; service that is offered through the page like www.domain.com/product-A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[seo]]></tab><version><![CDATA[2.2.5]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.6.6]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[59.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[69.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[54.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/1333111-pprod/pretty-urls-remove-ids-numbers-for-seo-friendly-url.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/1333111-pbig/pretty-urls-remove-ids-numbers-for-seo-friendly-url.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[16939]]></id><name><![CDATA[seoexpert]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[SEO Expert]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[SEO]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Increase site traffic by optimizing the position of your website on search engine results!

This allows you to control your budget by offering the right products at the right time and optimize your return on investment. In Shopping ads, the display of stars reflecting the rating of items undoubtedly gives more attractiveness to products. Google Merchant Center Pro allows you to export your customers' product reviews(*) and to participate in the collection and compilation of product reviews by Google. Finally, what better to encourage people to click and buy than a discount voucher featured in your ad? Thanks to our module you can filter and export the promotional codes to attach to your ads. (*)See conditions in "Features" section]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[smart_shopping]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.7.11]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[179.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[204.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[164.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/963142-pprod/google-merchant-center-pro-google-shopping-actions.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/963142-pbig/google-merchant-center-pro-google-shopping-actions.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[21273]]></id><name><![CDATA[pqeasypost]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Easy Post Pro (DHL, GLS, DPD, Colissimo, RoyalMail etc)]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Preparation & Shipping]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[This module allows you to significaly increase the speed of your shipping process by integrating EasyPost]]></description><author><![CDATA[ProQuality]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/preparation-shipping/21273-easy-post-pro-dhl-gls-dpd-colissimo-royalmail-etc.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/21273.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[This module allows you to significaly increase the speed of your shipping process by integrating EasyPost.com API (Application Programming Interface) into PrestaShop and printing your shipping labels fast and easy.

Think of how long it takes to receive an order from your customers, process the order by adding the products to the package, then connect to your shipping carrier`s software and manually insert the customer information, parcel information and delivery address for the order, for each order at a time. This is very time consuming and it`s very easy to make mistakes because you have a lot of data to process.  With this module all of this is done automatically via the API (Application Programming Interface) that connects the orders section in prestashop with the carrier and instantly sends the information to the carrier, then prints the shipping label which is then slicked to the package. The module supports the most important carriers in the world.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[shipping_logistics]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.8.1]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.5.0.0]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[99.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[114.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[94.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/726515-pprod/easy-post-pro-dhl-gls-dpd-colissimo-royalmail-etc.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/726515-pbig/easy-post-pro-dhl-gls-dpd-colissimo-royalmail-etc.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[21278]]></id><name><![CDATA[popnewsletter]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Newsletter Popup]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Pop-up]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[The most effective way to stay in touch with your customers!

Your customers can now check out with just their fingerprint anywhere on the web. As you’d expect, you’ll receive payment, shipping, and contact information so you can charge for physical goods, subscriptions, and more. Customers love the simplicity of Apple Pay, and you'll love the increased conversion rates and new user adoption that come with it. Accepting Apple Pay is easy. Apple Pay is easy to set up and gives your customers a simple and secure way to pay with the devices they use every day. Improve your website and give to your customers this easy, secure, and private way to pay. With the release of macOS Sierra and iOS 10, Apple Pay is coming to Safari on your Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Make your website ready for Apple Pay start now! Accepting Apple Pay is faster than accepting traditional credit and debit cards. Customers no longer need to spend time searching for their wallet and finding the right card. Your customers can check out with a single touch. Accepting Apple Pay is also more secure than accepting traditional credit and debit cards. Every transaction on your customer’s iPhone or iPad requires verification of the fingerprint using Touch ID, the face using Face ID or passcode. And each time your customer takes their Apple Watch off their wrist, the passcode must be entered to access it. In addition, you don't receive your customer’s actual credit or debit card numbers, so you aren't handling actual credit or debit card numbers in your systems when they pay with Apple Pay. Indiegogo saw conversions increase up to 250% when customers used Apple Pay to fund campaigns. OpenTable allowed diners to seamlessly pay for their meal via their iOS app and site. And Instacart’s customers completed checkout 58% faster with Apple Pay than other payment methods. One more thing : Apple doesn't charge you any additional fees!]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[payments_gateways]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.1.0]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.11]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.6.6]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[99.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[114.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[94.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/781469-pprod/apple-pay.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/781469-pbig/apple-pay.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[23517]]></id><name><![CDATA[pm_easyplaces]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Easy Places]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Registration & Ordering Process]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Easy Places is the fastest and easiest address autocomplete module on the market]]></description><author><![CDATA[Presta-Module]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/registration-ordering-process/23517-easy-places.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/23517.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Easy Places is the fastest and easiest address autocomplete module on the market.

On the Business Manager interface you have a multitude of options allowing you to create your advertising audiences according to age, sex, family situation, geographical location, interests, groups, liked pages and any other information that Facebook has about its users.&nbsp;By installing a tracking tag (Facebook pixel) on your site pages, our module allows you to&nbsp;further&nbsp;enhance these audiences. Indeed, this pixel allows you to create audiences based on&nbsp;your visitor activity (purchases, products seen, carts,...).&nbsp;It also allows you to enjoy the indisputable efficiency of&nbsp;dynamic retargeting. Thus, you can for example to launch ad campaigns that will automatically display to Facebook users, the products they previously viewed on your site, or relevant product recommandations. Business Manager tools will then allow you to analyse the efficiency of these ads (conversion tracking).&nbsp;The power of Facebook also allows you&nbsp;to acquire new customers&nbsp;by attracting people whose interests are close to your current customers. Indeed, the personal information of the social network users, own by Facebook, is compared to the one of your existing customers. You can therefore display your products to these audiences, which are similar to your clientele.&nbsp;Last but not least,&nbsp;the cost&nbsp;is also typically&nbsp;lower&nbsp;than Google&#39;s!]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[advertising_marketing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.3.13]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[99.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[114.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[94.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Conversion: Agencies&#39; choice"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/awards-convert-agency.png]]></badge><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/1351878-pprod/dynamic-ads-pixel.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/1351878-pbig/dynamic-ads-pixel.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[24239]]></id><name><![CDATA[facebookproductsfeed]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Products Feed: Dynamic Ads & Shop & Tagging]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[SEA SEM (paid advertising) & Affiliation Platforms]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[Creates a Product Catalogue to use with Facebook & Instagram]]></description><author><![CDATA[Smart Modules]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/sea-paid-advertising-affiliation-platforms/24239-products-feed-dynamic-ads-shop-tagging.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/24239.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[Creates a Product Catalogue to use with Facebook & Instagram.  Create Product Ads, use Instagram product tagging feature, display your products on your Facebook page, be ready for the Dynamic Ads*]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[With this easy-to-configure module you will be able to export your products and later import it to Facebook to create a Product Catalogue. The catalogue created can be multilingual and have different prices and currencies for each country, all of this in a single catalogue With the Facebook Catalogue you can do several things:Product Ads: Create ads using your Product CatalogueInstagram Product Tagging: Shop the look.

The biggest difference between dropshipping and the standard retail  model is that the selling merchant doesn’t stock or own inventory.  Instead, the merchant purchases inventory as needed from a third party   to fulfill orders.  With our Prestashop Aliexpress Dropshipping Module, The admin can import products and their combinations from AliExpress  into his prestashop store and can start selling those products within  his own store very easily without having to stock the products  physically.

With nearly 190 million active users per day, Snapchat has become the number one social network among 18-34 year olds thanks to its interactive and fun content that differs from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter standard formats. Moreover, faced with strong competition from brands that promote their products on major networks such as Facebook or Twitter, it has now become difficult to stand out and capture the attention of users. With fewer advertisers in Snapchat, it is much easier to get known and attract new customers to your site. Do you already advertise on other social networks such as Facebook or Instagram? Take advantage of Snapchat's innovative advertising formats and low competition to make yourself known to a new audience.  With the Snap Pixel, optimize the delivery of your ads to the Snapchatters who are most likely to purchase your products. Then track your campaigns effect by analyzing the number of actions (product view, add to cart, purchase,...) performed by Snapchatters on your site after interacting with your ad.Finally, and once you have reached the required threshold of interactions between Snapchatters and your site (https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/en-US/a/snap-pixel-faq#Audiences), use one of the most interesting features of the pixel, dynamic remarketing. Create custom audiences based on the Snapchatters' activity on your site and then capture their attention again on the social network with targeted ads to encourage them to return to your shop.]]></additional_description><tab><![CDATA[advertising_marketing]]></tab><version><![CDATA[1.0.0]]></version><compatibility><from><![CDATA[1.6.0.4]]></from><to><![CDATA[1.7.7.0]]></to></compatibility><price><EUR><![CDATA[49.99]]></EUR><USD><![CDATA[59.99]]></USD><GBP><![CDATA[49.99]]></GBP></price><badges><badge label="Modules Partner Creator"><![CDATA[https://medias2.prestastore.com/themes/prestastore/img/front/sprites/badges/module-editor.png]]></badge></badges><cover><small><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/1358306-pprod/snapchat-ads-pixel.jpg]]></small><big><![CDATA[https://medias3.prestastore.com/1358306-pbig/snapchat-ads-pixel.jpg]]></big></cover></module><module><id><![CDATA[46721]]></id><name><![CDATA[fruugo]]></name><displayName><![CDATA[Fruugo]]></displayName><categoryName><![CDATA[Marketplaces]]></categoryName><description><![CDATA[The Fruugo module, created together with Invertus, is designed to make it easy for retailers to generate orders from all over the world]]></description><author><![CDATA[Invertus]]></author><url><![CDATA[https://addons.prestashop.com/en/marketplaces/46721-fruugo.html?utm_source=back-office&utm_medium=push-addons&utm_campaign=back-office-EN&utm_content=download]]></url><img><![CDATA[https://medias1.prestastore.com/img/pico/46721.jpg]]></img><description_full><![CDATA[The Fruugo module, created together with Invertus, is designed to make it easy for retailers to generate orders from all over the world.]]></description_full><additional_description><![CDATA[The Fruugo Marketplace module, created together with Invertus, is designed to make it easy for retailers to generate orders from all over the world.
